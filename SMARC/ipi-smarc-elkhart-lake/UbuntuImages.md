## How to enable two Ethernet Ports

it is a workaround solution to modify grub file to enable two Ethernet functions.(Intel & Canonical is working to fix it)

Here is the steps:

1.  First edit the configuration file via command:

   ```
   sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
   ```

   When it opens, add **"intel_iommu=on "** into the line of **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT** and finally save the file.

2. Update grub to apply the configuration changes and then reboot.

   ```
   sudo update-grub
   ```
